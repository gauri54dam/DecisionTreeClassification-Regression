# DecisionTreeClassification-Regression

Dataset :-

1. Housing price CSV file
2. Abalone dataset

Problem statement:- 

1. Create a custom decision tree model using the house pricing dataset

 a) Split the dataset into training and test dataset 80:20

 b) Create a decision tree model for prediction in python class format. Fit the model using training dataset. Show the model and provide proper interpretation on each node split.

 c) Predict the house prices using the test dataset, and provide the performance metrics. 

 d) Do you see any overfitting? How to overcome the overfitting issues? 



2.  Classify Abalone dataset with the decision tree model

 a) Fit the decision tree model with RINGS as a response variable. How is the model performance? How do you interpret the model?

 b) Fit the decision tree with the custom response variable. Compare the model performance against logistic regression model. Do you find any interesting insights on decision tree model? Which model do you choose for this dataset?

c) If you would like to improve the performance of the decision tree using this model, what steps do you recommend?

d) What hyperparameters can you use for model optimization in the decision tree?

e) How do you control the depth of the decision tree in your custom model?
